Do you know what Bipolar Programming is?

It is a concept that we have created (well, at least that name is our creation). 
With bipolar programming, at the same time that a system is developed in a main 
and centralized branch, parts of code or entire modules gradually undergo, 
according to the time available, small or large changes, with changes 
in languages and frameworks (or, if you prefer, just programming paradigm changes), 
generating several stable versions for each module and, thus, several stable versions
of the project, in a dynamic development scheme.
Once fragments of a project are tested, and it turns out that they are working correctly 
according to the expected, loopholes are opened to improve them syntaxically.
In some cases (we don't recommend the risk), migrations can begin before the 
previous version stabilizes, when, although tests haven't yet been done due to lack of time,
or the module is still in development, the programmer is almost sure that the code written/yet to
be written will work with the current implementation. Well, be careful not to lose focus and productivity...
and it's obvious that you won't aplly Bipolar Programming in a simple console program that shows that 
1 + 1 is equal to 2, is not it?

--> Why should I use bipolar programming in my project or in my whole developer career?

 + wait for more...
